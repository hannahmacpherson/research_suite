Hello, this script will chop however much you want off the start and end of each of your sequences and save it to a file name of your choice.

-----------------------------------------------

You will need: 

- a plain text .txt file as an input. This can have as many sequences as you want, but they must be in the format:

> whatever descriptor you want
GAGAGTGCAGAGATA (sequence)

> descriptor for second sequence
GAGAGTGCAGAGATAAAAAAAAAAAAAATGSGSA (tricky 14-mer there)

>third descriptor
TATATATATATATATATATATA (yummy microsatellite)

** Note that you need the > in the descriptor or everything will break **
-----------------------------------------------

What to do:


1) Open the terminal and make sure you have python3. You can do this by simply typing python3 --version and it should print out something like Python 3.7 if you have it. If not, download it and follow install info online.



2) Navigate to the folder where you have put both trimmer.py and your input .txt file. Do this by typing in:
cd /Users/hannahmacpherson/Documents/python_practice/Projects/sequence_trimmer

** NB I need to update that bit above if other people are going to use it **

If you want to double check you're in the right place, type in ls and it should list everything in that folder, including those files. 




3) Type in what you want in the following way:

python3 trimmer.py bp_off_start bp_off_end input.txt output.txt

So for example, if I want to take 30bp off the start and 20bp off the end of every sequence in hannahisgreat.txt, and save that to ilovedrb1.txt, I would type the following:

python3 trimmer.py 30 20 hannahisgreat.txt ilovedrb1.txt

NB if you want to just update the original file with the trimmed sequences, you can call the input and output the same name.

The script should then confirm what it's done and you should find the file in your folder.
